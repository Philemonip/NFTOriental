# OrientalNFT

Oriental NFT is a marketplace for user-owned digital goods tokenized as ERC-721 compliant non-fungible tokens (NFTs) backed on a blockchain linked to a decentralized finance application (DeFi app) where users can acquire a ERC-20 compliant token issued by us to trade the NFTs. Some NFT collectibles are also tied to a 3D chat room and users who own these NFTs can interact with the assets in the chat room.

Our project can be seperated in three parts

OrientalNFT

OrientalNFT is a marketplace for user-owned digital goods tokenized as ERC-721 compliant non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through smart contracts backed on the Ethereum Blockchain. The NFTs are categorized into 6 unique collections, including art, avatar, exclusive events, sports, trading cards and virtual worlds for users to browse and purchase.

Users can create their own NFTs on our platform by uploading their work and list their NFTs on sale to trade with other users. Our NFTs are traded in Cinco Chicos Coin (CCH), a ERC-20 token, which users can acquire on our decentralized finance application (DeFi App) linked to our marketplace.

DeFi App

Our DeFi App implements a basic non-custodial protocol. Users are able to earn CCH as interest when they deposit ETH. After a transaction has been confirmed, the ETH deposited will be successfully locked in a smart contract on the blockchain and users will begin earning CCH interest. Upon withdrawal of their ETH, users will receive CCH in their digital wallet which would enable them to trade NFTs in our marketplace.

3D chat room (Bonfire)

We also created Bonfire, a 3D chat room, using three.js and socket.io. Users can hang around a bonfire to chat and interact with their friends. Users who own the NFTs of the virtual worlds collection in OrientalNFT can interact with these assets when they access the chat room."
